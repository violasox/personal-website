abstract: "A microfluidic platform recapitulating human embryonic heart beat improves the functionalization state of hepatocytes derived from hepatic endoderm (HE). Mechanical stretching of mimicked heart beats was applied to HE cells cultured on the microfluidic platform. Stimulated HE-derived hepatoblasts increased cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) metabolic activities and hepatoblast functional markers expression, leading for advancement of regenerative medicine and drug screening."
